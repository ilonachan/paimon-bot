A Discord conversation bot based on the character Paimon from Genshin Impact.

If you found this project randomly, please don't be too disappointed if it
doesn't do anything interesting. This is mostly a tiny roleplaying project
for my local server, and using the character of Paimon is more of a gimmick than anything else.
