A Discord conversation bot based on the character Paimon from Genshin Impact.

If you found this project randomly, please don't be too disappointed if it doesn't do anything interesting. This is mostly a tiny roleplaying project for my local server, and using the character of Paimon is more of a gimmick than anything else.

The code itself is licensed under the MIT License, because I want anyone to freely play around with this bot if they find it interesting.
